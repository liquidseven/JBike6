# JBike6
Jbike6 is a web application of a matlab program for calculating the weave and capsize speeds of a modeled back
More information and the actual matlab program found here 
[JBike6](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/bicycle_mechanics/JBike6_web_folder/index.htm)

[Current Build](https://jbike6.firebaseapp.com/)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* [Node](https://nodejs.org) 

### Installing
From your cmdline navigate to the Jbike6 folder 

Using npm (node package manager which should have installed with node)

Install react-scripts
```
npm install --save react-scripts
```
This should go through the package.json file and install all of the dependencies needed for the Jbike6 project

## Running Jbike6
Inside the Jbike6 folder
```
npm run start
```

Jbike6 should open up in your web browser locally on port 3000


## Authors
#### Original Jbike6 Matlab
* [Arend L. Schwab](http://bicycle.tudelft.nl/schwab/) - Assistant Professor of Applied Mechanics at Delft University of Technology. Wrote the main JBike6 engine in MATLAB.

* Jim Papadopoulos - Contributing Author of [Bicycling Science : Third Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/bicycling-science). Created the JBike concept and monitored its development. Worked closely with Scott Hand on his Masterâ€™s Thesis at Cornell University: [Comparisons and Stability Analysis of Linearized Equations of Motion for a Basic Bicycle Model](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/bicycle_mechanics/comparisons_stability_analysis.pdf)

* [Andy Ruina](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/) - Professor of Theoretical & Applied Mechanics at Cornell University. Lab advisor.

* [Andrew Dressel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdressel) - Graduate Student of Theoretical & Applied Mechanics at Cornell University. Created JBike6 GUI, on-line help, and original [Jbike6 website](http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/research/topics/bicycle_mechanics/JBike6_web_folder/index.htm)
